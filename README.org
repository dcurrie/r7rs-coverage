* Coverage of R7RS Implementations
A simple coverage analysis of the implementation of R7RS in various Schemes.

See https://ecraven.github.io/r7rs-coverage/

** Chez
You need the r7rs libraries in =~/scheme/chez=.
** Guile
The code assumes a Guile that supports =--r7rs= (3 at least).
** Implementation
Each file in =input= is one section of tests and is interpreted as the name of an import in addition to =(scheme base)=.
Each file is split up at each line starting with =;; TEST=.
The first word after =TEST= is the name of the test, the rest is the "subtest" name.
That code is prefixed with an import statement and a simple definition of =assert=, and run through the Scheme implementation with a maximum time of 5 seconds.

To add a support for a new Scheme:
- add it to =Makefile=
- add it to =coverage=
- run with =make new-scheme=
